# Fantasy-Football-Keeper-League
One of my fantasy football leagues is extremely complex, there is no website for us to draft from so everyone is left to their own devices to figure out who has been taken or not. Not only is there no automated draft board, the draft is split up into an auction where you come out with 8 players as well as a snake draft for another 8.
